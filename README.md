## 📌 Featured Project: Gourd Scanner (Flutter App)

### 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains **one complete and self-contained project** within my GitHub account and serves as the **final requirement** for my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology coursework.

The **README.md** file provides a comprehensive overview of the application, including its purpose, features, supported classes, and visual documentation. The repository is organized into folders for source code, screenshots, and image class samples, following common software development and GitHub repository standards.

## 🌱 Project Overview: Gourd Scanner

**Gourd Scanner** is a mobile application developed using **Flutter** that performs **image-based classification of gourds and squashes**. The application utilizes a trained image recognition model to identify different gourd and squash types from user-provided images.

The application allows users to:

* 📷 Capture images using the device camera
* 🖼 Upload existing images from the device gallery

After processing an image, the application displays:

* The predicted gourd or squash class
* The confidence percentage of the prediction
* Visual analytics summarizing detections
* A record of previous scan results

This project demonstrates the application of Flutter UI development, image processing, basic machine learning integration, and proper organization of mobile application features into a clear and user-friendly interface.

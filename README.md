## 📌 Featured Project: Gourd Scanner (Flutter App)

### 📖 About This Repository

This repository represents **one specific project** inside my GitHub account and serves as the **final project** for my Information Technology coursework.

The **README.md** explains what the project is about, how it is organized, and what features the application provides. Inside this repository, you will find folders for source code, screenshots, image classes, and supporting files. This structure reflects how GitHub repositories are typically organized for real-world projects.

## 🌱 Current Project: Gourd Scanner

**Gourd Scanner** is a mobile application developed using **Flutter**. It is an **image-based gourd and squash classification app** that helps users identify different types of gourds and squashes using a trained image recognition model.

The app allows users to:

* 📷 Capture an image using the camera
* 🖼 Upload an existing image from the gallery

After scanning, the app displays:

* The predicted gourd/squash class
* Confidence percentage of the prediction
* Scan analytics
* A history of previous scans

This project helped me practice Flutter UI development, basic machine learning integration, image handling, and organizing features into a clean and user-friendly mobile interface.
